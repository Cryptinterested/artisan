This Privacy Policy oversees the procedures for collecting, processing, and retaining Personal Data by Artisan Labs, Artisan Association and its affiliates 
("we," "us," or "our"). Please thoroughly review this Policy to understand the management of your Personal Data. "Personal Data" refers to information linked 
to an identified or identifiable natural person ("Data Subject").

## Blockchain Impact On Privacy Rights 

The immutability of blockchain data affects rights such as erasure and objection. Personal data, once written on the blockchain (e.g., wallet addresses, 
transactions), becomes permanent. Users are advised to exercise caution, acknowledging the public nature of blockchain transactions.

## Our use of Personal Data 

A. Website:

We gather and process data concerning website usage, including browser types, operating systems, IP addresses, etc. This aids in delivering content, 
optimizing website viability, and providing information for potential criminal prosecution in cyber-attack cases. The legal basis for this processing is 
legitimate business interests.

B. User Experience:

We may collect and process personal data, including names, wallet addresses, email addresses, and 
occupation. This helps in monitoring and enhancing services, with processing based on consent.

C. Social Media:

When using our X (Twitter) account, Medium, or other social media platforms, we may collect and process Personal Data for tracking marketing success and user 
demographics. Different data protection regulations may apply to these services.

D. Third-Party Applications:

We utilize various third-party applications (Vercel, PostMark, PlanetScale, AWS, GitHub, Google), each governed by its respective data protection provisions. 
Users are encouraged to review these provisions for a comprehensive understanding.

## Personal Data Sharing

We may share your information with clients, business partners, third-party service providers, and others for task completion and service provision. Personal 
information is disclosed to third-party service providers only as necessary for service delivery, ensuring information security.

## Data Security

We employ security measures to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure of personal data. Access is limited to those with a business need, subject 
to confidentiality obligations.

## Your Rights

Under applicable legislation, especially the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have various rights, including information access, rectification, 
erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, freedom from automated decision-making, and the right to object to processing.

## Storing Personal Data 

We retain information for the necessary processing purposes outlined in this policy. Longer retention may occur for legal compliance or vital interest protection.

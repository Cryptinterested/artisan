Artisan RPC orchestrates an auction involving a network of "searchers" who are afforded the opportunity to backrun your transactions. 
In return, these searchers provide protection against frontrunning and sandwich attacks—two forms of MEV that pose a constant threat to Ethereum users.
Upon the successful submission of winning bids through the orderflow auction, Artisan RPC directs the entire bid amount, distributing it at a split of 
x/y between users and validators. Validators retain y% as a reward, while users receive the remaining x% as profit—an earnings boost they would have 
missed out on without the safeguard offered by Artisan RPC.
By configuring Artisan RPC as the designated RPC in your wallet, treating it as if it were an additional network, you gain immunity from frontrunning and 
sandwiching when interacting with any Ethereum dApp. Additionally, the profits resulting from backrunning are automatically deposited into your wallet, 
bolstering both the security and financial advantages for users.

Disclaimer: $ART is not designed for conventional governance token purposes in on-chain DeFi protocols that necessitate
decentralization and specific distribution. Our utilization of the blockchain to govern Artisan represents an effort to 
leverage this technology and its advantages, enabling swift and atomic exchanges of Artisan protocol shares.

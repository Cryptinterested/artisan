To utilize Artisan Private Pool, it's essential to integrate the Artisan RPC endpoint into your wallet. 
This can be done effortlessly by following the provided instructions below. Please note that once Artisan RPC 
is successfully added to your wallet, it's advisable to periodically confirm that it remains selected as your chosen network.

In the event that your wallet lacks the capability to incorporate custom RPC endpoints, reaching out to your wallet developer 
becomes necessary to facilitate the inclusion of Artisan as a supported RPC.

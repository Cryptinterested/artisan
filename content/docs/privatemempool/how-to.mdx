To utilize Artisan Private Pool, it's essential to integrate the Artisan RPC endpoint into your wallet. 
This can be done effortlessly by following the provided instructions below. Please note that once Artisan RPC 
is successfully added to your wallet, it's advisable to periodically confirm that it remains selected as your chosen network.

In the event that your wallet lacks the capability to incorporate custom RPC endpoints, reaching out to your wallet developer 
becomes necessary to facilitate the inclusion of Artisan as a supported RPC.

Artisan RPC orchestrates an auction involving a network of "searchers" who are afforded the opportunity to backrun your transactions. 
In return, these searchers provide protection against frontrunning and sandwich attacks—two forms of MEV that pose a constant threat to Ethereum users.
Upon the successful submission of winning bids through the orderflow auction, Artisan RPC directs the entire bid amount, distributing it at a split of 
x/y between users and validators. Validators retain y% as a reward, while users receive the remaining x% as profit—an earnings boost they would have 
missed out on without the safeguard offered by Artisan RPC.
By configuring Artisan RPC as the designated RPC in your wallet, treating it as if it were an additional network, you gain immunity from frontrunning and 
sandwiching when interacting with any Ethereum dApp. Additionally, the profits resulting from backrunning are automatically deposited into your wallet, 
bolstering both the security and financial advantages for users.

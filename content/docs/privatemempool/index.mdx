## The notion of private mempool 

Artisan Private Pool offers you, a unique opportunity to capitalize on any initiated transaction using your wallet. 
Serving as an alternative platform where you'll submit your signed operations, it will protect your on-chain activity
from front-running, sandwiches exploits, and other complex attacks that could affect your on-chain activity.

On top of that, Artisan Private Pool will **allow refunds to its users**, thanks to searchers and on-chain traders, profiting for on-chain operations to make profits.

Several advantages of directing your transactions to Artisan Private Pool, and **use our rpc¹**:

- **Better Inclusion terms**: By bypassing the public pool, our private pool promptly forwards your transactions directly to major builders, while preserving your desired specifications.
- **Artisan API**: Our transaction API offers comprehensive status reports for transactions sent to our private pool. Refer to the [Transaction API Docs]() for more details.
